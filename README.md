<strong><u>Exercise #1:</u></strong> Develop a Java program (name it SumArrayColumns) that prints out the sum of each column of a two-dimensional array. The program defines method <em>sumColumn</em>() takes a two-dimensional array of integers and returns a single-dimensional array that stores the sum of columns of the passed array. The program main method prompts the user to enter a 3-by-4 array, prints out the array, and then calls method <em>sumColumns</em>(). Final, it prints out the array retuned by method <em>sumColumns</em>(). Document your code, and organize and space the outputs properly as shown below.

<u>Sample run 1:</u>




The entered matrix:

9    1    2    4

2    2    8    0

3    3    3    3




Sum of column 0 is 14

Sum of column 1 is 6

Sum of column 2 is 13

Sum of column 3 is 7




<u>Sample run 2:</u>




The entered matrix:

10   10   10   10

1    1    1    1

50   50   50   50




Sum of column 0 is 61

Sum of column 1 is 61

Sum of column 2 is 61

Sum of column 3 is 61




<u>Sample run 3:</u>




The entered matrix:

10   10   10   10

-10  -10  -10  -10

50   51   52   53




Sum of column 0 is 50

Sum of column 1 is 51

Sum of column 2 is 52

Sum of column 3 is 53







<strong><u>Exercise #2:</u></strong> Develop a program (name it LocateLargestElement) that prints out the location of the first largest value in a two-dimensional array. The largest values may appear more than once in the array. The program defines method <em>locateLargest</em>() that takes a two-dimensional array of integers and returns the location (row index and column index) of the first largest value as a single-dimensional array. The program main method prompts the user to enter a 3-by-4 matrix, prints out the matrix, and then calls method <em>locateLargest</em>(). Finally, it prints out the array retuned by method <em>locateLargest</em>(). Document your code, and organize and space the outputs properly as shown below.




<u>Sample run 1:</u>




The entered matrix:

9    1    2    4

2    11   18   20

3    20   3    12




First largest value is located at row 1 and column 3




<u>Sample run 2:</u>




The entered matrix:

19   11   22   44

29   51   81   20

23   90   45   90




First largest value is located at row 2 and column 1




<u>Sample run 3:</u>




The entered matrix:

89   11   22   44

29   51   80   20

33   10   45   10




First largest value is located at row 0 and column 0







<strong><u>Exercise #3:</u></strong> Develop a program (name it AddMatrices) that adds two matrices. The matrices must of the same size. The program defines method <em>Addition</em>() that takes two two-dimensional arrays of integers and returns their addition as a two-dimensional array. The program main method defines two 3-by-3 arrays of type integer. The method prompts the user to initialize the arrays. Then it calls method <em>Addition</em>(). Finally, it prints out the array retuned by method <em>Addition</em>(). Document your code, and organize and space the outputs properly as shown below.




<u>Sample run 1:</u>




Matrix A:

2    1    2

7    1    8

3    20   3




Matrix B:

1    1    1

1    1    1

1    1    1




A + B:

3    2    3

8    2    9

4    21   4




<u>Sample run 2:</u>







Matrix A:

2    2    2

2    2    2

2    2    2




Matrix B:

2    2    2

2    2    2

2    2    2




A + B:

4    4    4

4    4    4
